# PokerWinRate
This is the final project from the course "Introduction to programming in C" provided by Duke University

The programe takes a file, which contains the informations of the cards in each hands , as a input and calculates the win rate of each hands base on the ties of the hands (say "flush", "straight", "two pairs" ... etc).

Each card is represented as the format "(suit)(value)", for example 's1' is the ACE of SPADES.
Note that for suits, 's' means SPADE, 'h' means HEART, 'd' means DIAMONDS and 'c' means CLUB; for values, '0' means 10, 'j' means JACK, 'q' means QUEEN and 'k' means KING.
